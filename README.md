PANDS project looking at the iris data set



This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. 
You must research the data set and write documentation and code in Python to investigate it. 
An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it previously. 
You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. 


You might do that for this project as follows: 
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README. 
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository. 
3. Write a program called analysis.py that: 
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file, 
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and 
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. 
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.



Project outline. 

1 set up an issue to plan out project outline. 
2 make sure to reference as I go, link the references with the code I am using.
3 explain the code back to myself so that i fully understand whats going on in the code.
4 write my text files in my voice


1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.

The data set can be found online on UC Irvine Machine Learning Website.

Summary

The Iris dataset is one of the most popualr datasets used in statistics and machine learning. It was collected in 1936 by Statistician and Biologist Ronald Fisher. The purpose of the dataset is to classify the data based on its features.

The dataset contains fifty samples from three different types of Iris flowers; Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. It has four features that are measured for each of the fifty samples. They are; the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in cms.

Fisher used the data from this data set to create a linear discriminant model to distinguish each species. Following on from this it became a widely used test dataset for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning.
