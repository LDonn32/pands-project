# pands-project
PANDS project looking at the iris data set

Author: Laura Donnelly

This ReadMe file for the 2025 Programming and Scripting Module for the H. Dip in Science in Data Analytics, ATU will do the following:

*Give a description of the project objectives.

*State what technologies and libraries were used.

*Give an outline of the project's progress. (Perhaps with an issue on github. Unsure if I am using this correctly as of yet but been playing around with one that I can link later if works ok)

*Present additional information, comments and insights for code used in each of the tasks.

*Includes references and additional resources used.

# Project Objectives:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README. 
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
   
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
   
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file, 
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and 
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. 
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.



# Project outline:

1 (optional) set up an issue to plan out project outline. 
2 make sure to reference as I go, link the references with the code I am using.
3 explain the code back to myself so that i fully understand whats going on in the code.
4 write my text files in my voice


# Technologies used:


# Libraries / Packages used:


# **Project Tasks**

## *1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.*

The data set can be found online on UC Irvine Machine Learning Website.

More information I found helpful about the dataset on the Intuitive Machine Learning ToutTbe channel can be accessed via [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dLG3JDk2VU).

## Summary

The Iris dataset is one of the most popualr datasets used in statistics and machine learning. It was collected in 1936 by Statistician and Biologist Ronald Fisher. The purpose of the dataset is to classify the data based on its features.

The dataset contains fifty samples from three different types of Iris flowers; Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. It has four features that are measured for each of the fifty samples. They are; the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in cms.

Fisher used the data from this data set to create a linear discriminant model to distinguish each species. Following on from this it became a widely used test dataset for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning.
